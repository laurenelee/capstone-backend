#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

######### for volunteer type (not faker but a potential list like this):  (like to have an agency be able to be multiple things) list is an array
# randomly pick 1-5 and then grab randomly that many from the array  (1/4/18 do this later- it could be a join table  )
# seniors, homelessness, arts and culture, animals, advocacy and human rights, children and youth, computers and technology, community, education and literacy, health and medicine, disaster relief, LGBT, justice and legal, environment, faith-based, crisis support, immigrants and refugees, sports and recreation
